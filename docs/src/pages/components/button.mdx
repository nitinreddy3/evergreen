## Design Guidelines

By default buttons and controls have a height of `32px`.
It is possible to change this to any height and the text style and spacing will adjust.
You should however keep the height on the 8px or in some cases the 4px grid.
You should only need the following recommended heights.

### Recommended heights

* 24px
* 32px â€” default height
* 36px
* 40px
